{% include JB/setup %}

HELLO! My name is **John Crannell-Ash**. This site is designed to give a high level overview of my skills, work, and life experiences. I am currently employed by [Vanteon Wirieless Solutions](https://vanteon.com/), in Rochester New York, as an embedded software engineer. 

I earned my Master's in Computer Engineering with an emphasis in robotics and controls at the [University of California Santa Cruz](http://www.ucsc.edu), in 2015.

I have a diverse set of interests including robotics, software defined radios, autonomous vehicles, firmware, security, IoT, and embedded hardware design. 

I am actively interested in working on new projects. If you have any interest in  collaborating with me on one of my many projects, or feel I could provide help to your project; please contact me anytime at jcrash29[-at-]gmail.com

## Update Author Attributes

In `_config.yml` remember to specify your own data:
    
    title : My Blog =)
    
    author :
      name : Name Lastname
      email : blah@email.test
      github : username
      twitter : username

The theme should reference these variables whenever needed.
    
## Sample Posts

This blog contains sample posts which help stage pages and blog data.
When you don't need the samples anymore just delete the `_posts/core-samples` folder.

    $ rm -rf _posts/core-samples

Here's a sample "posts list".

<ul class="posts">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &raquo; <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

## To-Do

This theme is still unfinished. If you'd like to be added as a contributor, [please fork](http://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap)!
We need to clean up the themes, make theme usage guides with theme-specific markup examples.
