# Git

Over the last four years I have become very familiar and comfortable with git. I have realized several of my friends and colleagues are not fans of it, so I have compiled a list of common commands.

### git add -u

The -u option will stage all modified files. 

### git push origin :<branch>

Delete a branch from origin

### git commit --amend 

Rewrite history of the last commit and add The Current staged files to the last commit. 

### git submodule foreach <git command>

This will go through each of the submodules and run the given command.  Useful for a git checkout or a git clean/reset
