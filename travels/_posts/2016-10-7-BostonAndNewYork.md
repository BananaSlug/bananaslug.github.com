## Day 0: Uber

It was a late night last night. We went to a club in Minneapolis with a couple of friends and didn't make it home till 2 in the morning. This wouldn't normally be a problem because we are young and can handle the stress on our bodies. But this was different because the following after noon less than 8 hours later we were getting on a flight to Boston to see our friend Wilhelm,  and than go to a wedding in New York the following weekend. 

I feel a little like a country bumpkin saying this,  but I had never used uber until today. Our friend was no longer able to drive us to the airport, and therefore we had to find another way to get to the airport.  We decided to check uber and we're completely surprised when we saw that it would cost less than $20 to get there.  That is far less than the cost of parking off site.  I may never go back to driving myself to the airport.

We are currently taking off from Baltimore on our way to Boston and the flight has been rather boring except for the antectode the flight attendant told us about a Samsung Galaxy 7 which started on fire while on a flight of hers last week.  Forcing the plane to make an emergency landing and return to the terminal. Apparently the FAA has banned Galaxy 7s from being turned on while on flights.


## Day 0: Boston Public Transportation 

We landed in Boston after bumpy plane ride thanks To hurricane Mathew. Wilhelm met us outside the airport with hugs and excitement! We decided to take public transportation to get to his apartment. That meant riding on the first public transportation system in America. 

Sadly since it was night we were not able to see much,  but I now feel comfortable that wherever I am in Boston I won't get lost.

It has been a very long day,  and it has been great catching up with Wilhelm, but now it's time for sleep,  I'm excited to see Boston in the light.
