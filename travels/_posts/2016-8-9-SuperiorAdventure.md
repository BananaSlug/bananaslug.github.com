## Day 0: Goodbye Wilhelm, Hello Car

On Monday Marissa and I said goodbye to our good friend Wilhelm,  who was visiting from Boston for the weekend. Marissa and I were not looking forward to saying goodbye for many reasons, including the fact that we had a 5 hour car ride ahead of us. 

The Crannell's (My in-laws) planned a week long trip to Grand Marais with four dogs, and six people.  

The drive itself was uneventful,  however we did see several downed trees in Duluth due to a recent storm.  After picking up beer at a small liquor store we made it to the cabin at around 6. 

Bear,  (our dog)  was very excited to see his three  favorite dogs.  While the dogs played inside and out,  the rest of the family spent time playing card games and having a great time. 

All in all the trip has been a lot of fun,  and I am looking forward to our next couple days.
