# Grand Octagon Adventure (G.O.A.)

## Day 0: Goodbye Wilhelm, Hello Car

On Monday Marissa and I said goodbye to our good friend Wilhelm,  who was visiting from Boston for the weekend. Marissa and I were not looking forward to saying goodbye for many reasons, including the fact that we had a 5 hour car ride ahead of us. 

The Crannell's (My in-laws) planned a week long trip to Grand Marais with four dogs, and six people.  

The drive itself was uneventful,  however we did see several downed trees in Duluth due to a recent storm.  After picking up beer at a small liquor store we made it to the cabin at around 6. 

Bear,  (our dog)  was very excited to see his three  favorite dogs.  While the dogs played inside and out,  the rest of the family spent time playing card games and having a great time. 

All in all the trip has been a lot of fun,  and I am looking forward to our next couple days. 

## Day 1: Always Falling For You

The first day has officially begun.  We started early taking the dogs out and getting them tired. After breakfast  we laid the dogs down for an afternoon nap, and went out on a very long adventure. 

We traveled north along Lake Superior, passing the Grand Portage and stopping at US Canada border. None of us had thought to bring our passports so instead we got out at the rest stop and decided to hike along the Pigeon river which separates the United States and Canada.  

As the hike went along three of us got separated from the other three because we were off exploring. In order to locate the other group we began making a loon call using our hands.  After sometime Diane noticed our call and had Jamie make the call back to us, allowing us to find each other.  After locating each other and after a short hike,  we reached two separate lookout points for the High falls.

There are three falls along pigeon river the high falls,  middle falls,  (Some other falls), you can tell they were very creative people.

The high falls were easy to reach, so we decided to walk the 3 miles,  round trip to Middle falls. After about 1.5 miles of walking we asked someone how far we were,  he told us we were halfway.  At that point most of the family turned back, leaving just Jamie and I to carry on.  In the end it took twice as long as we predicted and we can promise that it was NOT 3 miles round trip. 

I can't promise it was 'worth' it, but we did  see some very cool plants.

* Raspberries
* Thimble-Berries

## Day 1:  Dog Lifeguard 

After the long day in the kennel we knew we needed to tire the dogs out.  Our house is very close to Lake Superior so we decided to take the dogs down to the lake for a good romp.  

The four dogs piled out of the car and onto the rocky beach. There were 2-3 foot waves on the beach,  which initially the dogs were scared of.  Luckily I was wearing boots from my wet suit, and was able to convince the dogs to come in the water with peer pressure. After a couple minutes the dogs were loving it in the waves,  soon we started playing fetch into the water which was a great time. 

I stayed in the water just in case one of the dogs got into trouble, but after 10 minutes it became clear that the dogs were not gonna run into any trouble.

## Day 2: Rainy Lazy day

Waking up this morning it was sprinking slightly,  so we decided today would be a good day for shopping.

After a large pancake breakfast we drove down to the city and explored the shops including, Ben Franklin, and The Trading Post. For lunch we had Sven and Oles Pizza. (Not worth the hour wait).

## Day 2: [Where's Beardo](http://www.whereswaldo.com/m/images/maps_troy.jpg)

At the end of the day,  the family loaded into the van and drove for several hours hunting in the hopes of seeing a bear or a moose. 

The following animals were seen

We were only lucky enough to see the moose so well thanks to the great moose whisper.

We stopped at the campground that Diane and Jamie use to teach at.  The Albert Lee Summer Science camp. Jamie and Diane use to teach there in the 80's, and hadn't been back in nearly 8 years.
