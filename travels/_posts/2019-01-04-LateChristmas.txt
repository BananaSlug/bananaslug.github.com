# Day 0 - Late Christmas  is better than no Christmas 

This year has been crazy and we're only 4 days in. My job has given me plenty of new things to learn. Lluckily in tthe last week ai have completed enough work that my colleagues are confident I can succeed . That one fact makes me feel 100x more comfortable since I'll be spending the next 9 days traveling across the country to visit the vast majority of my family.

This morning I woke up early and washed more dishes and gave more left overs to my neighbors (The Commune). Ran to work early so I could sneak out and get to the airport with time to spare. Often  I deem it unnecessary to get to the airport so early. However, since the government has enter week 3 of the Government Shutdown, with the TSA being directly affected I figured it was better to play it safe.

There was no need.... All we ended up doing was playing more pokemon than is necessary . 

Still though we got on our flights and headed to our first stop. MINNESOTA
