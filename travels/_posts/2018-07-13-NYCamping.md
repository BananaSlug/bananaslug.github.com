# Day 0 - The Day Before Danger

Tomorrow we leave for the Adarandocks. Two campsites. Three dogs. Four cars. Ten people. Due to the amount of gear we were brining we needed to finish packing 24 hours early, and load it into one truck. 

The problem: we didnt get together to pack. So everyone brought their own pots and pans, their own food, their own 6 person tents. Each person bringing the items to share. Somehow we managed to tetris the truck, and are gonna live like kings.

# Day 1 - Friday 13th, 66,666 miles on the car

I'm starting to regret this trip. I got in the car and noticed it had exactly 66,666 miles on the car. It is also Friday the 13th. I think it might be a good idea to simply lay in bed and sleep.

This morning we started the day by eating at the local Highland Diner. Than we all boreded into the car and started our 4 hour drive. The car ride was pretty boring, until about halfway through when we saw the initial attack on Canada. After the terrifying helicopters i have officially accepted the fact that we had gone too far on this auspicious day.

According to Tim there is also a super moon and a solar eclipse. It is clear we are about to star in "Cabin In The Woods".

I dont know if i feel safe at the camp site. The camp was evicting the person next to us because he had been their for two weeks. He was completely out of his mind that he didnt even realize he was talking to the sheriff for 20 minutes. In total there was 4 cop cars, an ambulance, and a tow truck.

After that extremely eventful afternoon. Tim, Doug, Chris and I went to a local golf course. Sadly the one that was half a mile down the road was  closed, so we drove 15 minutes into lake placid to play another local course. The four of us played 9 holes of golf. It was absolutely beautiful. I didnt do well,  but that wasnt the goal, it was still a lot of fun!
