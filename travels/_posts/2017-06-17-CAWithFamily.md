# Day 0 South Dakota + Fire

9:30 in the morning we left the Crannell's house to drive to Madison (not Wisconsin) South Dakota for a friend's wedding.  It was extremely nerdy with magic wands, light sabers,  Pokemon,  and D&D -- it was excellent and very them. 

A couple of days previously the Crannells had started driving to California and happened to be in Brian Head Utah, that is until Brian tried to kill them, by starting a fire. 

They were quickly evacuated from the mountain,  and were without service for 5 hours, so we didn't know if they were okay or not. (HINT: they were okay). 

# Day 1 - SD - MSP - LAX - OC

Last night we celebrated our good friends wedding in Madison South Dakota.  The only issue is that we had a plane trip from Minneapolis at 3, which means we had to start an early drive to get to the airport in time. 

All the traveling was terrible,  but at least we are seeing all of my family + my in laws.  

When we got into LAX, and out to the baggage claim we discovered California's favorite hobby: honking. 

Luckily we saw our parents drive passed us,  and we ran after them and managed to get in their car. 

The drive to Tustin wasn't bad (surprisingly). As soon as we got to my parents house we started a BBQ, and talked all through the night. 

# Day 2: New Port Beach (Come at me Poseidon) 

On Monday we woke up super early because the sun was shining directly into our room.  Which was fine because it gave me time to spend with my parents.  My mom and I sat down outside on the porch and had a great conversation which the parrots in the trees went wild. 

For breakfast we ate my moms special rolls, totally unhealthy and totally tasty. We than made a plan go to New Port Beach,  Diane's old stomping ground. 

At the beach George and I decided to take on Poseidon again in the 6-8ft swells.  This was the same location where two years previously a wave had knocked the 4 of us siblings over and stole Marissa's glasses. The moral of the story, "no one beats Poseidon".

We stopped over and had my first good Mexican food in years.  Along with a margarita the size of my head.  

After all that sun we decided we needed a nap so we headed home, and all took a 2-3 hour nap. Once again talking through the night. 

# Day 3 OC to Santa Barbara

It was another lovely morning waking up to coffee with my mom. We chatted for an hour about all parts of life. At around 8:30 people began to wake up and we started to pack for our trip up north.  By waiting till after 9:30 we managed to avoid some (read: not enough)  traffic.
