Hey everyone, thanks for reading about our adventures!!! A couple of quick notes:

* Marissa and I will not have access to 4G/3G/Texting/Calling
* The best way to get ahold of us would be to install the encrypted text messaging App [Signal](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dorg.thoughtcrime.securesms%26hl%3Den_US%26referrer%3Dutm_source%253Dgoogle%2526utm_medium%253Dorganic%2526utm_term%253Dsignal%2Btexting%26pcampaignid%3DAPPU_1_FMJhW7WnGImKjwTh2ZjQBA&ved=2ahUKEwi1ga_dhszcAhUJxYMKHeEsBkoQ5YQBMAB6BAgJEAI&usg=AOvVaw0CfzsW4VbETQb-lzvpjH0j&cshid=1533133341101)
* We will return August the 10th.
* Most of our trip will be spent in St. Andrews.
* Bear is being watched by three friends

# Day 0 - That snuck up on us

When you plan a vacation 5 months in the future it is possible you might completely forget about the trip when it comes time to pack for it. That was the situation here. Although we knew the trip started August first, our bodies seemed to the think there was atleast 40 days in July.

Needless to say, packing has been a but haphazard. But by July 30th, we were nearly packed, and had dog sitters for Bear.

But on July 31st the strangest thing happened. A friend and I were talking about our flights on the first,  when we realized we were on the same first flight with the same 4+ hour layover. This trip was already starting off awesome!


#  Day 1 - Flights, Friends and **** ups.

Having mostly finished packing the night before we had a great morning resting and cleaning the house. Our first flight was set to leave at 11:45, plenty of time to get to the airport and play Pokemon.

For the last hour we met up with  Russ and Lisa and hung out.  As an extravert there is nothing friends cant make better. 

When we got onto the first flight to NYC, we were already asked for our passports! Befuddled we searched our bags and delivered the goods. However all was not good because this distraction allowed us to sneak our suitcase onto the small plane. It very clearly could not fit in the bins, and I had to maneuver myself upstream on the plane with a giant suitcase. I fear Marissa will not let me live this down.

After our first flight we landed in JFK, New York City! It was really cool flying over Hudson bay seeing NYC in the distance. Marissa, Russ, Lisa and I sat down for late lunch at a nice Italian restaurant.  After catching up and eating food we played banangrams. Which was a lot of fun, but it was clear Russ and Lisa had a lot more practice playing scrabble compared to us.

Our next flight is a "red eye" leaving NYC at 7 arriving in Manchester at 6:30.... flight time 7 hours. If we want to get our sleep schedules on track than we need to try our best to sleep.  Im sad about that,  because I wanted to watch Black Panther.

After 6 hours of killing time in anyway we could we boarded our plane, named The Pretty Woman. It was a double decker plane, and our seats were on the top in the exit road behind 1st class. The cloest seat in front of us was 7 feet. Thats more than the people in first class.

Sleeping on planes is the worst. Its apperently 7 in the morning (So they tell me), but Im deciding to believe my phone which says 2.

# Day 2 - Too early for this bull que

Now I understand why our tickets were so cheap. One hour plus change is not enough time to get through customs and borded onto our next flight. The real issue was the hour line/Que to get a picture of your face taken. 

The American in me saw that line, and than heard our flight calling last call. I immediately darted to the front of the line, and got though in under 3 minutes..... There is definitely a part of me that felt bad. But that part of me quickly disappeared as I left Marissa behind and sprinted towards our gate. As I reached the gate, nearly in tears the operator told me the worst(?) news ever..... There was never any rush, the flight was still missing 55 passenger's and they were going to wait for them all. IM AVOIDING MANCHESTER IN THE FUTURE! AT ALL COSTS!!!



Hours later Marissa and I finally calmed down. John and Amanda met us at baggage claim with love and hugs. The journey to St. Andrews took about 1.5-2 hours from  Edinburgh.  But time seemed to fly by as we caught up with old friends.

For dinner we went to a local pub. I had fish n chips. Marissa had a wonderful steak pie. I decided now was as good a time as any to try a Scottish IPA. It was a shipwreck (the name of the brewery, not the taste). I don't think any IPAs here will compare to the IPAs in America. But it's worth trying. 

The four of us than decided to have a youtube party, and did our best to 'not laugh'. 

.... THAN WE PASSED OUT HARD!!!

# Day 3 - Jetsome and Flotsam 

Jet lag sucks.

The morning started with us going out for waffles. I tried both blood pudding and haggis. I think my biggest issue with it was the texture, it reminded me of falafel. 

After breakfast we walked around St Andrews. The city is so small and quaint. We went into the golf museum.  It was very interesting,  I wasn't aware of how long golf had been being played. 

We than took a jaunt along the North Sea where apperently Chariots of Fire was filmed. The ocean/beach here is extremely flat and at low tide just stretched on forever.

On our way back up the beach we wondered upon a location where bricks, stone, and tile had been discarded. Marissa and I spent over 30 minutes looking at the items,  and collected quite a bit of fun stuff.

At this point in the day a nap was required. 

At around dinner time we woke up and wandered into the other side of St Andrews where there was a very old castle. We walked along Bunny Island. Watched a family catching crabs with small bags of raw chicken. 

It has been an amazing two days with John and Amanda.
