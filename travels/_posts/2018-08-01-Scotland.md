Hey everyone, thanks for reading about our adventures!!! A couple of quick notes:

* Marissa and I will not have access to 4G/3G/Texting/Calling
* The best way to get ahold of us would be to install the encrypted text messaging App Signal.
* We will return August the 10th.
* Most of our trip will be spent in St. Andrews.
* Bear is being watched by three friends

# Day 0 - That snuck up on us

When you plan a vacation 5 months in the future it is possible you might completely forget about the trip when it comes time to pack for it. That was the situation here. Although we knew the trip started August first, our bodies seemed to the think there was atleast 40 days in July.

Needless to say, packing has been a but haphazard. But by July 30th, we were nearly packed, and had dog sitters for Bear.

But on July 31st the strangest thing happened. A friend and I were talking about our flights on the first,  when we realized we were on the same first flight with the same 4+ hour layover. This trip was already starting off awesome!
