Hey everyone, thanks for reading about our adventures!!! A couple of quick notes:

* Marissa and I will not have access to 4G/3G/Texting/Calling
* The best way to get ahold of us would be to install the encrypted text messaging App [Signal](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dorg.thoughtcrime.securesms%26hl%3Den_US%26referrer%3Dutm_source%253Dgoogle%2526utm_medium%253Dorganic%2526utm_term%253Dsignal%2Btexting%26pcampaignid%3DAPPU_1_FMJhW7WnGImKjwTh2ZjQBA&ved=2ahUKEwi1ga_dhszcAhUJxYMKHeEsBkoQ5YQBMAB6BAgJEAI&usg=AOvVaw0CfzsW4VbETQb-lzvpjH0j&cshid=1533133341101)
* We will return August the 10th.
* Most of our trip will be spent in St. Andrews.
* Bear is being watched by three friends

# Day 0 - That snuck up on us

When you plan a vacation 5 months in the future it is possible you might completely forget about the trip when it comes time to pack for it. That was the situation here. Although we knew the trip started August first, our bodies seemed to the think there was atleast 40 days in July.

Needless to say, packing has been a but haphazard. But by July 30th, we were nearly packed, and had dog sitters for Bear.

But on July 31st the strangest thing happened. A friend and I were talking about our flights on the first,  when we realized we were on the same first flight with the same 4+ hour layover. This trip was already starting off awesome!


#  Day 1 - Flights, Friends and **** ups.

Having mostly finished packing the night before we had a great morning resting and cleaning the house. Our first flight was set to leave at 11:45, plenty of time to get to the airport and play Pokemon.

For the last hour we met up with  Russ and Lisa and hung out.  As an extravert there is nothing friends cant make better. 

When we got onto the first flight to NYC, we were already asked for our passports! Befuddled we searched our bags and delivered the goods. However all was not good because this distraction allowed us to sneak our suitcase onto the small plane. It very clearly could not fit in the bins, and I had to maneuver myself upstream on the plane with a giant suitcase. I fear Marissa will not let me live this down.

After our first flight we landed in JFK, New York City! It was really cool flying over Hudson bay seeing NYC in the distance. Marissa, Russ, Lisa and I sat down for late lunch at a nice Italian restaurant.  After catching up and eating food we played banangrams. Which was a lot of fun, but it was clear Russ and Lisa had a lot more practice playing scrabble compared to us.

Our next flight is a "red eye" leaving NYC at 7 arriving in Manchester at 6:30.... flight time 7 hours. If we want to get our sleep schedules on track than we need to try our best to sleep.  Im sad about that,  because I wanted to watch Black Panther.

After 6 hours of killing time in anyway we could we boarded our plane, named The Pretty Woman. It was a double decker plane, and our seats were on the top in the exit road behind 1st class. The cloest seat in front of us was 7 feet. Thats more than the people in first class.

Unsane (didnt get a chance to finish this one)

Sleeping on planes is the worst. Its apperently 7 in the morning (So they tell me), but Im deciding to believe my phone which says 2.

# Day 2 - Too early for this bull que

Now I understand why our tickets were so cheap. One hour plus change is not enough time to get through customs and borded onto our next flight. The real issue was the hour line/Que to get a picture of your face taken. 

The American in me saw that line, and than heard our flight calling last call. I immediately darted to the front of the line, and got though in under 3 minutes..... There is definitely a part of me that felt bad. But that part of me quickly disappeared as I left Marissa behind and sprinted towards our gate. As I reached the gate, nearly in tears the operator told me the worst(?) news ever..... There was never any rush, the flight was still missing 55 passenger's and they were going to wait for them all. IM AVOIDING MANCHESTER IN THE FUTURE! AT ALL COSTS!!!



Hours later Marissa and I finally calmed down. John and Amanda met us at baggage claim with love and hugs. The journey to St. Andrews took about 1.5-2 hours from  Edinburgh.  But time seemed to fly by as we caught up with old friends.

For dinner we went to a local pub. I had fish n chips. Marissa had a wonderful steak pie. I decided now was as good a time as any to try a Scottish IPA. It was a shipwreck (the name of the brewery, not the taste). I don't think any IPAs here will compare to the IPAs in America. But it's worth trying. 

The four of us than decided to have a youtube party, and did our best to 'not laugh'. 

.... THAN WE PASSED OUT HARD!!!

# Day 3 - Jetsome and Flotsam 

Jet lag sucks.

The morning started with us going out for waffles. I tried both blood pudding and haggis. I think my biggest issue with it was the texture, it reminded me of falafel. 

After breakfast we walked around St Andrews. The city is so small and quaint. We went into the golf museum.  It was very interesting,  I wasn't aware of how long golf had been being played. 

We than took a jaunt along the North Sea where apperently Chariots of Fire was filmed. The ocean/beach here is extremely flat and at low tide just stretched on forever.

On our way back up the beach we wondered upon a location where bricks, stone, and tile had been discarded. Marissa and I spent over 30 minutes looking at the items,  and collected quite a bit of fun stuff.

At this point in the day a nap was required. 

At around dinner time we woke up and wandered into the other side of St Andrews where there was a very old castle. We walked along Bunny Island. Watched a family catching crabs with small bags of raw chicken. 

It has been an amazing two days with John and Amanda.

# Day 4 - St Andrews C&C

Today we visited the St Andrews Carhedral and Castle. Our first stop was the cathedral. Its amazing to me how old some of these graves are. It was also astounding how much fighting between the catholics and protestants existed. If it weren't for these battles I cant even imagine how beautiful these structures were.

At the castle we went on a very fun audio tour. It was so silly and so much ridiculous acting. But I think my favorite part was that John Bliss had to wear his cape in order to show he was a student.

# Day 5 -  St Andrews to Edinburgh 

Now that we had throughly explored St Andrews it was time to visit Edinburgh. Its about a 1.5 hour trip down, luckily for the  majority of the trip we were able to sit. Our first stop of the day was at the Edinburgh zoo. We didnt realize at first that the zoo was built into a hill and therefore any exhibit we wanted to visit was up hill (both ways in the snow).

We attempted to view the famous (since 1951) voluntary penguin march. Sadly 

The meerkat exhibit was also amazing! They were placed directly at the entrance to the zoo. They were extremely active and playful.

After our zoo trip we had an appointment at an extremely nerdy bar, [The Popup Geek](). John and Amanda had been at this bar a couple months ago when it was Rick and Morty themed. This time it was Lord Of the Rings themed, and it was simply excellent. All of the drinks were properlt themed and so tasty.

After getting thoughly lubricated we walked the mile to our Air BnB for the next couple days. Pizza was quickly consumed from a nearby arcade bar and good sleep was finally had.

# Day 6 - The Royal mile. (1.125 miles)

After our long walk home last night we all agreed taking the bus was the best option. We took the bus to Holyroode which is the working castle in Scotland. Over the summer months the Queen stays in that castle abd normal business is conducted. We went on an Audio tour of the castle and its history. I was very interested in learning more about Mary Queen of Scots and James the VI. Their story seems extremly perilous. 

We debated walking to the highest point in Scotland (Arthurs Seat, but quickly determined that since it was only noon and we weren't gonna get home till midnight. It was best to avoide it.

The Holyroode marks the end of the royal mile. But for us it marked the start. From this point on, everything was up hill to the Edinburgh Castle

About halfway along our walk we stopped at the museum of childhood. Mostly for a squished penny, but it was also good to play dress up at.

We quickly than after stopped at The Worlds End a pub that for 200 years was located at the edge of the Edinburgh walls incase of the English attack. (They never did come)

After a lovely meal of Haggis and Tikka Masala (two meals, not one), we made our way through the Fringe Festival crowds and to Edinburgh Castle.

Sadly it wasnt till we got there  at nearly four that we learned they would be closing early at 5:30. We decided to pay anyways, and had no regrets. We saw the great hall, their tomb of the  unknown solider. I looked in several books from the 1914's for references for the Gordons that died in battle.  (It was a lot).

We finished the trip by seeing the queens jewels and stopping at the whiskey shop. The views from the top of the castle were outstanding. Sadly we were getting chased off by the fact that the castle was closing, but also it had started to rain.

At this point we were very concerned about the rain, because in 4 hours time we would be returning to Edinburgh Castle for the Military Tattoo.

Four hours to kill, rain to hide from, all of us extremely tired and weak. Whats the best thing to do? Sleep? Lay down? Surly not dance the mock'a'rina? Instead we choose to go on a lovely tourist trap called Camera Obscure. 

One or two of John and Amandas friends had recommend Camera Obscura. It turned out to be great fun. They had rooms with science, rooms meant to trick your senses and rooms where you couldnt quite tell what was going on.

At the top of the tower we had nearly a good a view as Edinburgh Castle, and it kept us out of the rain. The only exit from the Obscura was a mirror maze, making it a Literal Tourist Trap. Though I think all four of us (and the wild pack of roving children) all agreed that the Vortex Tube was by far the coolest and though off all of our balances.

After exiting Camera Obscura I was sent to fo reteieve our tickets from  Will Call which was at the  bottom of the hill. Ughhhhhhh! It feels like a mountain after walking along it all day.

We settled in at the Military Tattoo,  not really sure what to expext. It was a great time showcasing warriors/armys from around the world. Amazing music making me truly respect the bagpipe as a instrument of war/battle. It was an experience that can never be replicated. 

Thanks Mom and Dad for recommending it, and helping us make it a reality! It was worth it. Also we went on your anniversary, which I thought was funny.

I don't  think any of ua us remember the walk home that night, but we were all grateful to sleep in a bed.
