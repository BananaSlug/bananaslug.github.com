Hey everyone, thanks for reading about our adventures!!! A couple of quick notes:

* Marissa and I will not have access to 4G/3G/Texting/Calling
* The best way to get ahold of us would be to install the encrypted text messaging App [Signal](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dorg.thoughtcrime.securesms%26hl%3Den_US%26referrer%3Dutm_source%253Dgoogle%2526utm_medium%253Dorganic%2526utm_term%253Dsignal%2Btexting%26pcampaignid%3DAPPU_1_FMJhW7WnGImKjwTh2ZjQBA&ved=2ahUKEwi1ga_dhszcAhUJxYMKHeEsBkoQ5YQBMAB6BAgJEAI&usg=AOvVaw0CfzsW4VbETQb-lzvpjH0j&cshid=1533133341101)
* We will return August the 10th.
* Most of our trip will be spent in St. Andrews.
* Bear is being watched by three friends

# Day 0 - That snuck up on us

When you plan a vacation 5 months in the future it is possible you might completely forget about the trip when it comes time to pack for it. That was the situation here. Although we knew the trip started August first, our bodies seemed to the think there was atleast 40 days in July.

Needless to say, packing has been a but haphazard. But by July 30th, we were nearly packed, and had dog sitters for Bear.

But on July 31st the strangest thing happened. A friend and I were talking about our flights on the first,  when we realized we were on the same first flight with the same 4+ hour layover. This trip was already starting off awesome!


#  Day 1 - Flights, Friends and **** ups.

Having mostly finished packing the night before we had a great morning resting and cleaning the house. Our first flight was set to leave at 11:45, plenty of time to get to the airport and play Pokemon.

For the last hour we met up with  Russ and Lisa and hung out.  As an extravert there is nothing friends cant make better. 

When we got onto the first flight to NYC, we were already asked for our passports! Befuddled we searched our bags and delivered the goods. However all was not good because this distraction allowed us to sneak our suitcase onto the small plane. It very clearly could not fit in the bins, and I had to maneuver myself upstream on the plane with a giant suitcase. I fear Marissa will not let me live this down.
