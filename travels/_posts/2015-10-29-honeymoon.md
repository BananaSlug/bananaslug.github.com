Thursday October 29th exactly two months after our wedding my wife and I will be traveling to New Zealand. 

I intend to use this post to blog our daily trips, and share our pictures. 

# Day 0 - Eden Prairie

In my experience I find that the day before a trip is the most stressful. I generally will have completely forgotten to pack anything and so will spend half the night throwing things in a suitcase until all that's left is the kitchen sink. This trip however Marissa has not allowed me to fall into my general traps. Instead I've gone over my packing list at least 30 times and yet, I'm certain I will have inevitably left something behind. Generally this situation is avoided by me packing more. However with this trip Marissa and I are limited on space.

Not only do we not wish to pay the outrageous bag checking fees. We will also be traveling to multiple cities and would have to carry our suitcases around with us. Therefore we have limited ourselves to a backpack each and a single suitcase.

Marissa and I are nearly finished packing, our suitcase is zipped and the electronics are charging.

Today at work I could hardly get anything done out of pure excitement for the upcoming trip. However in between my code reviews and git merges I managed to snag Marissa and I single digit seats on two of our flights tomorrow. This is a large improvement upon the previous seats where we were multiple rows apart from each other.

I'm so excited for tomorrow because when we go to sleep tomorrow I will be with my lovely wife next to the ocean.
