# Day 0: Late Christmas  is better than no Christmas 

This year has been crazy and we're only 4 days in. My job has given me plenty of new things to learn. Lluckily in tthe last week ai have completed enough work that my colleagues are confident I can succeed . That one fact makes me feel 100x more comfortable since I'll be spending the next 9 days traveling across the country to visit the vast majority of my family.

This morning I woke up early and washed more dishes and gave more left overs to my neighbors (The Commune). Ran to work early so I could sneak out and get to the airport with time to spare. Often  I deem it unnecessary to get to the airport so early. However, since the government has enter week 3 of the Government Shutdown, with the TSA being directly affected I figured it was better to play it safe.

There was no need.... All we ended up doing was playing more pokemon than is necessary . 

Still though we got on our flights and headed to our first stop. MINNESOTA

# Day 1: Congratulations Chad and Becca

We finally reached Chaska/Victoria a little after 1 in the morning. Our goal was to sneak into the house undetected by the multitudes of dogs. Success seemed out of reach.  However it seems the dogs were as tired as us after their evening romp, because only one dog was disturbed and was back asleep quickly.

After a good nights rest in the pig room we were finally able to properly greet the family and dogs. It was weird having so few dogs here, there was only FIVE!!! The standard is atleast 9 puppies. (Dont worry tomorrow will return to normal). 

After a morning of coffee and fruit the family decided to go get lunch in Excelsior and do some last minute christmas shopping. We had a full afternoon of shopping before Marissa and I quickly rushed off to our friends wedding.

The night was amazing. The bride was beautiful and it gave us an opportunity to catch up with all our old friends! Marissa and I really enjoy living in Rochester, but there is something about returning home..... Even if just for a couple days.

# Day 2: Happy Birthday to the puppies!

MERRY CHRISTMAS everyone! Sure were a couple weeks late. But its family that really makes it christmas. The Crannell side of the family has a tradition of opening stockings with each other.  So everyone saved their stocking stuffers until we were with each other.

After spending time together for a couple hours it was time to get ready for a Golden-Retriever birthday. Two years ago Maple had 5 puppies which were nicknamed the Kind litter, with each dog being named after a kind person. Today all 5 dogs are being trained to be service dogs with Helping Paws. They all came home to say hi to each other and to Mama Maple. It was a great party, with a lot of KIND dogs, and people.

The final part of the day was spent having a fire in the backyard. This is a fairly normal thing for the Crannell's even if it is blustry cold. Marissa and I invited some friends we rarely get to see (Kertzman + Jade, Nick + Caitlin). The fire was great. It gave us ample opportunity to talk, and catch up. Also to scar Jamie by talking about Anime (Food Wars).

# Day 3: LAZY DAY!

Today I decided not to do nothing-for-no-one.
