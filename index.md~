{% include JB/setup %}

HELLO! My name is John Ash, and I am a graduate student from the [University of California Santa Cruz](http://www.ucsc.edu). I graduated with a BS in Computer Engineering in 2013, and am currently finishing my MS in Computer Engineering (with an emphasis in robotics and controls).  

I am actively looking for full-time engineering positions in the Twin Cities Area. I have a diverse set of interests including robotics, aviations, controls, firmware, and embedded hardware design. 

This website is designed to provide a high level overview of my skills, interests, and projects.

Please feel free to contact me anytime at jcrash29[-at-]gmail.com

I look forward to speaking with you.

Read [Jekyll Quick Start](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/jekyll-quick-start.html)

Complete usage and documentation available at: [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com)

## Update Author Attributes

In `_config.yml` remember to specify your own data:
    
    title : My Blog =)
    
    author :
      name : Name Lastname
      email : blah@email.test
      github : username
      twitter : username

The theme should reference these variables whenever needed.
    
## Sample Posts

This blog contains sample posts which help stage pages and blog data.
When you don't need the samples anymore just delete the `_posts/core-samples` folder.

    $ rm -rf _posts/core-samples

Here's a sample "posts list".

<ul class="posts">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &raquo; <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

## To-Do

This theme is still unfinished. If you'd like to be added as a contributor, [please fork](http://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap)!
We need to clean up the themes, make theme usage guides with theme-specific markup examples.
